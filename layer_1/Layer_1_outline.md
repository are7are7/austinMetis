Machine Learning: Algorithms and Applications
Layer 1 Outline

Summary: In Layer 1 of the course we aim to do three things.  First off we need to make sure everyone is up to speed with several important Python libraries as well as a software development framework that will allow avoid real install / configuration annoyances throughout the course.  Secondly we introduce all of the major machine learning concepts that will be discussed in the course, and give you an intuitive feel for the sort of problems each is geared to solve, their similarities and differences, etc.,  Finally we want to dive into easy-to-use implementations of these algorithms and show you how to use / play with them.  Along the way we are going to look at several real applications and learn how to use Python (and scikit-learn in particular) to solve them.

I.   Layer 1 practical things
	A.  Docker - why and how to use it
	B.  Python + Jupyter notebooks
	C.  Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Pandas libraries - just the basics
II.  Machine learning from 1000 feet up
	A.  Main problem types: regression, classification, and dimension reduction (a.k.a. supervised and unsupervised learning)
	B.  The main algorithms used for supervised learning: kernels, trees, and neural networks
	C.  The core algorithms of unsupervised learning: PCA and K-means clustering
III.  Using scikit-learn and TensorFlow for supervised and unsupervised learning
	A.  Text mining, image, and recommendation applications
