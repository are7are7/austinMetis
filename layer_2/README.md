## Layer 2 materials

In Layer 2 we peel back the onion one layer and examine the fundamental concepts underlying all of today's major machine learning algorithms.  These include the notions of mathematical optimization, cost functions, gradient descent, the nature of cross-validation, and feature extraction / transformation.  To flush out the details of feature extraction / transformation we will examine a variety of applications from metadata and text mining to computer vision.
